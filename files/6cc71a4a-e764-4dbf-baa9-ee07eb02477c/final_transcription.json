  "Narratives": {
    "symptoms_management_of_pain": "Yes - as described above I try to wear corset regularly and on \"mild\" days with a Bow Padded bib to feel without corset",
    "symptoms_freedom_of_movement": "It can do as it is quite large. However when it starts becoming difficult I put on the binder",
    "symptoms_restriction_and_adaptation": "It can restrict activities I get on with life by using a abdominal binder. I have tried many ones but finally found one I like. It allows me to run my dancing class too. Yes as above used abdominal binder/corset It helps me a lot but is difficult to wear in hot weather",
    "employment_financial_pressure": "It would if I did not work but I use the binder & get on with it. I will consider not earning money, simply cannot afford not",
    "employment_return_to_work_issues": "I dont let it affect my work as I cannot afford to not work",
    "employment_costs_to_family": "N/A",
    "body_image_changes_to_perceptions_of_self": "Definitely so I try to hide it by using my corset. I want to go out without it as otherwise it is quite visible and I feel it makes me obvious. I hate being seen by anyone in the street.",
    "body_image_fears_concerning_perceptions_of_others": "Oh definitely they do. If I dont have my corset & someone (someone like the post woman in my village) I can see they are quite shocked & want to ask but are being polite. It looks and somehow draws attention to it myself hence I use it. I have to do that and feel \"here we go again\". I hate that feeling of having to explain myself",
    "mental_health_emotional_responses": "Yes it has. I used to be incredibly fit. Over time this has reduced and I feel twice old. It contributed greatly when I got a job that I considered \"dummy job\". Not giving dancing lessons. Mostly I could let it affect that. I did have feelings of low mood but have never been diagnosed to have depression.",
    "mental_health_disruptions_to_previous_identity": "N/A",
    "mental_health_coping_strategies": "Not being able to act on feeling of \"wanting\" to give up being a dance teacher. I will forced me to face the situation. I think I am better adjusted to the situation and that is just how it is.",
    "interpersonal_relationships_changes_in_sexual_relations": "I have a supportive partner. Our relationship is one of companionship rather than intimacy",
    "interpersonal_relationships_difficulties_in_connecting_socially": "I try not to let it affect me. As I said I find my corset very helpful. I put it on & go out for activities. Social activities help me cope with the hernia a lot so I have to get myself out there & do what I like.",
    "SharedDecisionMaking_Questions": "If anything can be done. Surgery will wall surgery be a high risk surgery. Will surgery fail again.",
    "SharedDecisionMaking_Hopes": "that I am put on a waiting list for surgery",
    "SharedDecisionMaking_Matters_To_You": "to have this monstrosity gone!"
