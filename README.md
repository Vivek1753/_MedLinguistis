This project is a complete, offline-capable NLP system that processes patient narratives and medical metadata to produce structured Quality of Life (QoL) reports. It combines transformer-based thematic classification, sentiment and emotion analysis, and vector search using LangChain for context-aware insights. A FastAPI backend provides easy API access, enabling seamless integration with healthcare applications and local deployments without reliance on external APIs.
